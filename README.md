# forensic-cases-bonnie
Hi 👋 I’m Bonnie, a junior Data Science student building skills in **digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)**. This is where I document my learning journey, including my learning from projects, case-style investigations, reports, and notes from training platforms. 

# what’s inside
- 👮 Case Investigations: simulated forensic cases (e.g., data theft)
- 📝 Learning Notes: summaries from TryHackMe, KC7, and other DFIR training resources.
