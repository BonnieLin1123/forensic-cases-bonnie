# Autonomous Vehicle Priorities
    As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become one of the leading trends today, plenty of questions concerning their decision-making system while facing accidents arise. For example, an AV is driving on a poorly lit street at night when a pedestrian suddenly jaywalks into its path. Ideally, the vehicle’s detection system should identify pedestrians early enough to prevent accidents. However, if the pedestrian is detected too late, the AV has only a few options: it could brake hard, which might hurt the passenger inside; hit the pedestrian, which could be fatal or cause serious injuries; or swerve into the surrounding environment or property, causing damage to surrounding environments and infrastructure. The complexity of these decisions requires ethical considerations during the design phase of the AVs, and consequentialism and deontology can be effective in evaluating AV’s decision-making on who or what we should prioritize ethically. Consequentialism evaluates the morality of an action based on its consequences or outcomes. Applying this ethical framework ensures that AVs can select the option that results in the least overall harm. On the other hand, deontology asserts that ethical decisions should be guided by moral duties to protect and not harm humans rather than purely looking at the consequences. This approach prevents us from being only outcome-based but considering the fundamental moral responsibilities. Combining these two approaches allows us to make balanced, rational, and impartial decisions. From these ethical frameworks, one can reason that human life should be prioritized, followed by the protection of the environment and surrounding property.
    The highest priority should be passenger safety due to AV designers having a duty to protect those who entrust their lives to the technology, the potential negative consequences on AV adoption if passengers feel unsafe, and their disadvantaged position in legal cases. When using an AV, passengers expect the vehicle to prioritize their safety, creating an implicit agreement and mutual trust between users and manufacturers. This aligns with deontological principles that it is the manufacturer’s moral duty to ensure and prioritize passenger safety rather than a choice based on circumstances. From a consequentialist perspective, if AVs were designed to prioritize pedestrians or external factors, fewer people might be willing to use them due to concerns about potential risks. Public concerns can cause the slowdown in AV development because of the loss of passengers leading to fewer people wanting to purchase AVs. Thus, the new technology for AVs to reduce human driving errors and prevent future accidents will be limited and stagnant. Legal biases further justify prioritizing passenger safety in AV decision-making. In legal cases, the law tends to protect pedestrians as their priority even when pedestrians are responsible for creating a dangerous situation, such as jaywalking or crossing unsafely. For example, in the Uber self-driving car case, a pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg was fatally hit while jaywalking with her bicycle on a poorly lit road at night. Her actions, along with the AV’s failure to detect her and execute an emergency brake, caused the accident to happen. Still, the Uber test driver was held legally responsible and sentenced to three years of supervised probation. However, if the pedestrians followed traffic laws, they would never encounter situations where their safety needs to be compared with passengers. Thus, prioritizing passenger safety is a more justifiable approach, ensuring a safer and more rational transportation system overall.
    Pedestrian safety should be the second priority according to consequentialist ethics in consideration of the potential harm of pedestrians in a traffic accident and the negative social perspectives it would create. Pedestrians are especially vulnerable in traffic incidents, they could be seriously injured once they get hit because they often do not have any protection. A collision can result in severe injury, long-term disability, or even death, impacting their well-being, financial stability, and overall quality of life while fatality places a severe emotional and economic burden on their family, friends, and loved ones. They would struggle a long time to recover. The societal impact of protecting pedestrians is also essential as pedestrian injuries or fatalities affect the public perception of AVs. Pedestrians represent broader public sentiment toward AV technology. If AVs frequently strike pedestrians without any systems to protect them, they will be perceived as a threat to pedestrians. The public may protest against the industry and governments would impose stricter regulations or even ban the technology. As the public’s trust toward AV technology erodes, the public could turn to favoring human drivers, making there no use in inventing or improving the AV technology. As a result, negative public perception of AV safety could hinder the industry's progress. Therefore, designing AVs to minimize pedestrian harm is not only a responsibility concerning their severe personal and familial harms but also a crucial step in ensuring long-term technological advancement as supported by consequentialist ethics.
    In addition to valuing human life, the environment and surrounding properties should be considered the third priority as AV designers have a moral obligation to protect public resources. From a consequentialist standpoint, protecting infrastructure is also essential due to its high reparation costs, its critical role in maintaining daily public operations, and the potential public discontent that could undermine trust in the AV industry. Once the infrastructures get damaged, passengers or the AV company may be held financially responsible for the destruction. Regardless of who bears the cost, it will inevitably become a financial burden and potentially affect their well-being due to the concerns and stress of paying off the debt. Beyond the economic and psychological consequences, the stability of transportation networks, city operations, and essential services could be largely disrupted. These could prevent people from reaching work or school and business operations could be delayed, leading to financial losses and decreased productivity. The public would then place blame of the inconveniences on various parties, including the passenger or the AV company, for causing the incidents and failing to implement systems that prevent the AV from damaging the surrounding environment and properties. The public’s discontent will also lead to the reduction of AVs’ market acceptance, limiting the total revenue of AV industries. Therefore, prioritizing the safety of public infrastructure is not only a moral obligation for AV designers but also a necessary response to the potential consequences of damaging the sustainability of urban systems.
    The methods to rank safety priorities in AV decision-making are primarily to ensure the minimization of harm in both individual and societal and the maximization of fundamental moral responsibility. While human life should always be prioritized, passenger safety is ranked higher as they are the primary users of the AV so it is the designer’s moral duty to prioritize passengers’ lives. Next comes pedestrian safety, because of their vulnerability and lack of protection in traffic accidents. The safety of the environment and surrounding property comes third due to the high financial and societal infrastructure damage costs. This ranking aligns with ethical principles that are evaluated rationally and impartially by prioritizing human life, minimizing damages, and ensuring the long-term success of AV technology and societal well-being. As the designer of AV safety decision-making, integrating consequentialism and deontology ensures that ethical decisions can balance safety, fairness, and real-world practicality.
